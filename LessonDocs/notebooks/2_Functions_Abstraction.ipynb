    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: We still have the `calculate_square` function that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List of Numbers**: We create a list `numbers` that contains the sequence of numbers we want to calculate the squares for. This makes it easy to modify the sequence if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loop**: We use a `for` loop to iterate over the list `numbers`. For each number in the list, we call the `calculate_square` function and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a list, we make our code more flexible and easier to modify. If we want to calculate the squares of a different set of numbers, we only need to change the contents of the list.\n",
