# Introduction to Lists

Welcome to the COSC2409 Spring 25 Functions lesson! In this module, we will explore the fundamental concepts of functions in programming. Functions are essential building blocks in software development, allowing for modular, reusable, and organized code. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of how to define, invoke, and utilize functions effectively in your programs.

Refer to the documentation provided in the `LessonD`ocs` folder for detailed explanations and examples that will guide you through the various aspects of functions. Let's dive in and enhance our programming skills together!

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

Some of our examples use Jupyter Notebooks.  Please refer to your course shell for a guide on how to isntall these (or use Google Colab).  You can also find a guide on how to do this at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks.
